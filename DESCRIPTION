Description: We consider the problem of fully Bayesian posterior estimation and uncertainty quantification in undirected Gaussian graphical models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) under recently-developed element-wise graphical priors, such as the graphical horseshoe. This package allows posterior MCMC sampling using a reverse telescoping block decomposition for Gaussian Graphical Model under element-wise priors on the precision matrix, which achieves an order of magnitude time complexity reduction compared to the cyclical sampler in high dimensions.
